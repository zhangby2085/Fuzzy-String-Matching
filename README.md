# Fuzzy-String-Matching
# First paragraph: general description
Project EVOLUZ, financed by the Academy of Finland (duration: 2017-2021) is a research project, which addresses the need to understand and support historians' work tasks in digital invironment.  Our goal is to understand and to develop methods and tools for improving information interactions of the end users accessing digital cultural heritage collections.  The research is based on the task-based information interactions (TBII paradigm). Personnel: Dr. Heikki Keskustalo (research leader), Dr. Sanna Kumpulainen (user studies), Dr. Boyang Zhang (constructive research and development). National and international cooperation: Dr. Jaap Kamps, University of Amsterdam; Dr. Kimmo Kettunen, National Library of Finland; Dr. Marko Tikka, University of Tampere; Dr. Krisztian NBalog, University of Stavanger; Dr. Thea Lindquist, University of Colorado Boulder.  This GitHub site is intended for documenting and sharing the programming codes developed during the research.

In addition to historians themselves, the digital methods in history research have drawn the attention
of researchers in information studies. Our fields of study include information retrieval and
information behavior. This is an international research effort aiming at supporting digital historians
research work tasks. The context of the research is historianâ€™s research work and we will particularly
focus on (a) research processes and needs descriptions of the historians' work tasks, and (b) the study
the information retrieval in historical document collections, and how to support these with fuzzy
matching methods.
# Second paragraph: research-oriented description: history domain, research problems (goals), data and methods/methodology (TBII viewpoint), NEs
Traditionally, digital access methods in historical research have been studied from the viewpoint of
the document collections and data. Instead of this data-centric view, we adopt information interaction
centered view towards accessing digital collection. Information interaction is understood as
behavioral and cognitive activities related to task planning, searching and selecting information items,
working with information items, and synthetizing and reporting.
Information interaction encompasses searching in the larger task context. This means that the actions
are framed by a motivating task that triggers searching. We aim at better understanding the rationale
behind actions and by this enable combining task-based approach into tool development and
evaluation.
